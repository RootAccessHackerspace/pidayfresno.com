  project: Sabertooth Deathbot
  description: Take a discarded wheelchair and use a Sabertooth 2x32 dual channel, regenerative power supply to turn it into death on 6 wheels.  In this example we use a FlySky FS-I6X RC controller and receiver.  Sabertooth 2x32 comes with it's own motor controller pre-processor for ramping and power control.  It is programmed with Arduino libraries, .NET (C#, VBS) and Dimension Engineering's DEScribe software.
